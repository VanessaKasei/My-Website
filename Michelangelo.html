            <b><u>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni</u></b>, known as Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet
            of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and
            had a lasting influence on Western art. He was born on 6 March 1475, Caprese Michelangelo, Itay and died on 18 February 1564, Rome, Italy

           <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/LWfyK5hL1f1jbZsZ7">The frescoes</a> on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (1508â€“12) in the Vatican, which include the iconic depiction of the
            creation of Adam interpreted from Genesis, are probably the best known of Michelangelo's works today, but the artist
            thought of himself primarily as a sculptor. Michelangelo's most famous works have to be his <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/M9FMkKoqjGYxCuwAA">Pieta</a> , his <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/AgoYS3B76XHH3U5w5">sculpture of David</a>. The Statue of David embodies the city of Florence, symbolizing independence and strength in the perfect image of
            youthful beauty. Michelangelo's David took on new meaning shortly after its creation as both a symbol of the Renaissance
            and a representation of the city itself.The third one being his painting of the <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/28TZdkkRanzAetgTA">Sistine Chapel.</a>
            ceiling, both of which reside in Italy.
